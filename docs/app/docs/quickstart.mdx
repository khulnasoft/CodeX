## Background

Codex is a command-line tool that lets you easily create reproducible, reliable dev environments. You start by defining the list of packages required by your development environment, and codex uses that definition to create an isolated environment just for your application. Developers can start their dev environment by running `codex shell` within your project.

To learn more about how Codex works, you can read our [introduction](index.md)

This Quickstart shows you how to install Codex and use it to create a new Development Environment for your project.

## Install Codex

Follow the instruction from [the installation guide](./installing_codex.mdx).

:::note
If you want to try Codex before installing it, you can open a cloud shell on your browser using the link below

## Create a Development Environment

We'll create a new development environment with the packages we need. These packages will only be available when using this Codex shell, ensuring we donâ€™t pollute your machine.

1. Open a terminal in a new empty folder.

2. Initialize Codex:

    ```bash
    codex init
    ```

    This creates a `codex.json` file in the current directory. You should commit it to source control.

3. Search for packages to add to your Codex project with `codex search`.  For example, to search for Python packages, you can run the `codex search python3`

4. You can add a package to your project by running `codex add <package>`. For example, running the following will install the latest available version of RipGrep in your project:

    ```bash
    codex add ripgrep
    ```

    If you want to install a specific version of a package, you can run `codex add <package>@<version>`. For example, to install Python 3.10, you can run:

    ```bash
    codex add python@3.10
    ```

5. Your `codex.json` file keeps track of the packages you've added, it should now look like this:

    ```json
    {
        "packages": [
            "ripgrep@latest",
            "python@3.10"
        ]
    }
    ```

## Launch your Development Environment

1. Start a new shell that has your packages and tools installed:

    ```bash
    codex shell
    ```

    :::info
    The first time you run `codex shell` may take a while to complete due to Codex downloading prerequisites and package catalogs required by Nix. This delay is a one-time cost, and future invocations and package additions should resolve much faster.
    :::

    You can tell you're in a Codex shell (and not your regular terminal) because the shell prompt and directory changed.

2. Use your favorite packages.

    In this example we installed Python 3.10, so let's use it.

    ```bash
    $ python --version
    Python 3.10.0
    ```

    We will also have the latest version of ripgrep installed in our shell:

    ```bash
    $ rg --version
    ripgrep 13.0.0
    -SIMD -AVX (compiled)
    ```

3. Your regular tools are also available including environment variables and config settings.

    ```bash
    git config --get user.name
    ```

4. To exit the Codex shell and return to your regular shell:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

5. To share your project and shell,  make sure to check in your `codex.json` and `codex.lock` file into source control. These files will ensure that developers get the same packages and environment when they run your project.

## Add the Codex Badge to your Repo

Once you publish your Codex project to Github, you can help other developers get started by adding the Codex Badge to your repo. Please copy the code snippets below and paste them into your README.md to add the badge
