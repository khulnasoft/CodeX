## Cloud Documentation

[Khulnasoft Cloud](https://cloud.khulnasoft) gives your team the tools and frameworks to accelerate your
development workflow. Khulnasoft Cloud is built on top of
[Codex](https://www.khulnasoft/codex), a powerful tool for spinning up
reproducible, isolated development environments on any machine.

:::info
Khulnasoft Cloud is currently available in Early Access. We're actively working on adding new features and improving the platform. To learn more, share your feedback, or follow our progress, join our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/khulnasoft).
:::

Khulnasoft Cloud currently includes:

**[Khulnasoft Cache](./cache/index.md)**: Provides a secure, private cache to share packages across all your Codex projects and environments, whether sourced from Nixpkgs or Flakes. Avoid rebuilding custom packages locally or in CI. 

**[Khulnasoft Secrets](./secrets/index.md)**: Securely store secrets and variables for all of your environments, and automatically synchronize them with your Codex Shells and Scripts

**[Khulnasoft Deploys](./deploys/index.md)**: Deploy Codex projects as autoscaling, stateless services. See your changes live and in production as soon as you push to your repository, no extra DevOps or Config required.

More features are coming soon, keep an eye on our [**blog**](https://www.khulnasoft/blog) for future updates!
