This doc contains answers to frequently asked questions about Khulnasoft Cloud that are not covered elsewhere in our documentation. If you have a question that isn't covered here, feel free to ask us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/khulnasoft)

## Do I have to pay to use Khulnasoft Cloud?

Khulnasoft accounts are free for individual developers, and includes access to Khulnasoft Secrets and the Khulnasoft Prebuilt Cache.

Using Khulnasoft with a team requires a paid Khulnasoft Solo, Starter, or Scale-up account. For details on other plans and limits, see our [**pricing**](https://www.khulnasoft/cloud/pricing) page.

## How can I share my Khulnasoft Cloud project with other developers?

To share secrets and access to deployments with other team members, you will need to create a new Khulnasoft Starter Team and then invite developers to join your team. See the [cloud dashboard docs](./dashboard/creating_your_team.md) for more details.

## How do Khulnasoft Cloud Plans work?

Khulnasoft Cloud Plans are available for a monthly platform fee, and allow you to share your Khulnasoft Cloud resources with your team, along with increased support levels. All plans include usage credits equal to the monthly platform fee, which are billed at standard usage rates. 

For more details, see our [**pricing**](https://www.khulnasoft/cloud/pricing) page.

## Do you offer self-hosted or private instances of Khulnasoft Cloud?

We offer private instances and other features as part of our Enterprise Plan. [Contact us](https://calendly.com/d/3rd-bhp-qym/meet-with-the-khulnasoft-team) so we can build a solution that meets your needs.

## How does pricing for Khulnasoft Deploys work?

Khulnasoft Deploys cost $0.10/vCPU per hour while your deployment is scheduled. If your Deployment is idle for more than 15 minutes, Khulnasoft Cloud will automatically scale down your deployment to zero. You are not charged for usage while your deployment is scaled down.

## How does pricing for Khulnasoft Cache work?

The Khulnasoft Prebuilt Cache is included in your subscription for no additional cost.

Khulnasoft Private Cache costs $0.60/GB of storage per month for the first 50 GB, and $0.50/GB per month after that. Khulnasoft Private cache does not charge for bandwidth or downloads.

## What size instances are available for Khulnasoft Deploys?

You can configure the following instance sizes for your Deployment.

| Instance | CPU | RAM   |
| -------- | --- | ----- |
| XSmall   | 0.1 | 512MB |
| Small    | 0.5 | 1GB   |
| Medium   | 1   | 2GB   |
| Large    | 2   | 4GB   |
